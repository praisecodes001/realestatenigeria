                       <p>
                        Real Estate Nigeria (REN) is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between real estate agents, property owners, and potential clients. 
                        Our mission is to simplify the real estate process by providing a seamless, professional, and secure environment where property transactions
                        can thrive. Whether you're an agent looking to showcase your listings, an owner wanting to connect with professionals, or a 
                        client searching for your ideal home, REN is built to meet your needs.</p>
                        
                       <h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: red;">How REN Works</h2> 
                        
                        <p>At REN, we ensure a structured and organized approach to real estate listings and transactions.
                        Here's how our system functions:</p>
                        
                       <h3 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" >For Agents:</h3> 
                        
                       <p>Agents are required to register to gain full access to our listing features.
                        
                        They can create, edit, and delete any of their personal listings, ensuring they have complete control over their property portfolio.
                        
                        The platform offers a dashboard where agents can track their listings, view engagement metrics, and manage inquiries from interested clients.
                        Agents have the opportunity to connect with property owners who need assistance in selling or renting their properties.
                        </p> 
                        <h3 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" > For Property Owners:</h3>
                       
                        
                       <p>Owners must register to interact with agents and manage their properties effectively.
                        
                        They can connect with trusted agents who will help them list, market, and sell or lease their properties professionally.
                        
                        Owners benefit from expert insights and real-time communication with agents to ensure smooth property transactions.</p> 
                        
                        <h3 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" >For Clients (Property Seekers):</h3>
                       
                       
                        
                        <p>Unlike agents and owners, clients do not need to register to explore property listings.
                        
                            They have full access to browse through available properties, search by location, price, and other key criteria.
                            
                            Clients can contact agents directly via the different media platform to inquire about listings and schedule viewings.
                            
                            The user-friendly interface ensures an efficient search experience, allowing clients to find their dream homes with ease.
